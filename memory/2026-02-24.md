## Daily Trades
- **QQQ ORB-FVG:** +$266 (executed)
- **IWM ORB-FVG:** +$742 (executed)
- **TSLA CALL:** +4.03R (simulated/paper-only — Alpaca doesn't support TSLA options)
- **CAT IB Bull:** OPEN (6 contracts, 0DTE, simulated entry)
- **Daily P&L:** +$1,008 | **Account:** $27,695 (+3.8% day, +84.6% YTD)

## Development — ORB Exit Strategy Testing

**Tested 3 Exit Approaches on 5-ticker universe (AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, QQQ, IWM):**

| Strategy | EV/Trade | Win Rate | Delta vs Baseline |
|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **BASELINE (4:1 Target)** | **+0.198R** | **30.2%** | — |
| VWAP RETEST | +0.132R | 30.2% | ❌ -0.066R |
| 1-HOUR BAR | -0.145R | 24.1% | ❌ -0.343R |

**Decision:** Stick to 4:1 fixed target. Both alternatives underperformed.

**Why VWAP retest failed:**
- Catches runners theoretically, but in practice the 4R exit is locked in.
- Waiting for VWAP retest often gives back 50-75% of the open profit.
- Example: Hit +4R, price fades to VWAP at +1R → lost 3R of profit.

**Why 1-Hour bar failed:**
- Arbitrary time exits on 0DTE are losers.
- Cuts winners before they reach target, or realizes losses that could have recovered.

## Code Changes
- `scripts/backtest_orb_exits_simple.py` — Created for fast testing (skips expensive signal detection)
- No changes to live scanner (keeping 4:1 baseline)

## Known Limitation
**TSLA Options Not Tradeable on Account:**
- Alpaca either doesn't support TSLA options, or account tier lacks access.
- TSLA signals are auto-simulated (paper-only) — capital doesn't deploy, doesn't count toward 65% limit.
- Discovered via TSLA trade ID 17 investigation (is_simulated=1, order_id=NULL).

## Previous: Inside Bar Bug Fix
Already committed (c35034d) — EV improved after fixing bar reference:
- IB Bull: +0.438R → +0.50R (+0.062R, +1.6pp WR)
- IB Bear: +0.233R → +0.26R (+0.027R, +0.7pp WR)

## TSLA ORB Alert Issue (Feb 25 Morning) — Resolved

**What Happened:**
- TSLA ORB alert fired with entry $402.97, stop $402.96, risk $0.01
- OR was correct ($397.64-$401.52), but FVG was a micro-gap (1-cent width)
- This represents a gap between one candle's high ($402.96) and next candle's low ($402.97)

**Root Cause:**
- Detector found a valid but unrealistic bullish FVG of only $0.01 width
- Such tight gaps are intrabar noise with poor risk/reward

**Fixes Deployed:**
1. Hard floor on FVG width: $0.05 minimum (commit `aac0631`)
2. Hard floor on risk: $0.02 minimum (commit `5b5d14a`)
3. Pre-market bar filter to prevent stale OR (commit `d4110e2`)
4. Data staleness/pre-market validation (commit `36d5d83`)

**Status:** ✅ Resolved - micro-gaps now rejected by width filter

## Status
- Scanner: improved with FVG width validation, all patterns live
- Kalshi weather: 10 trades open, settlement Feb 26 @ 5 PM MT
- Account: healthy, position sizing verified correct
- Next: Monitor Kalshi settlement; watch for CAT IB Bull result
